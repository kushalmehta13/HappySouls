## What do we want to do?
- Research project?
- Working application?
- Something that we can put up as a medium article?
- A fun project that just makes your soul happy but does nothing for humanity. Eg: ML/AI that puts emotion to a potato. :stuck_out_tongue:	

## Why do we want to do this?
If its not obvious by this point then we have no reason...
